# SCALA: Working Example

In this repository, I am going to save one quick working example of the `SCALA` language.

### CLI: Command to run
First for this project, you are going to open one window on the `CMD`, and open the directory in which your scala code is:

```shell
scalac <nameofthefile>.scala
```

After that command, to compile our code, we are going to execute this command:

```shell
scala run <nameofthefile>.scala
```
